# GraphCatalyst


## Inspiration

Our inspiration for GraphCatalyst came from the intersection of two powerful technological trends: the explosive growth of e-commerce product networks and the remarkable capabilities of GPU-accelerated graph analytics. We observed that while e-commerce platforms collect vast amounts of co-purchasing data, they often struggle to extract actionable insights efficiently due to the sheer scale and complexity of these product networks. Traditional CPU-based graph analysis becomes prohibitively slow as networks grow to millions of nodes and edges. We envisioned a system that could harness GPU acceleration to unlock deeper, faster insights from e-commerce networks while providing an intuitive natural language interface for business users to interact with these complex graphs.

## What it does

GraphCatalyst is a powerful GPU-accelerated graph analytics platform specifically designed for e-commerce product networks. It provides:

1. GPU-accelerated graph algorithms with automatic fallback to CPU when GPU is unavailable
2. Intelligent product recommendations using multiple strategies (similar products, complementary products, trending products)
3. Community detection to identify natural product groupings and categories Influence analysis using PageRank and centrality metrics to identify key products in the network
4. Path analysis to understand product relationships and customer journeys
5. Interactive visualizations of product networks, communities, and metrics
6. Natural language querying through an AI agent that leverages both ArangoDB and GPU-accelerated analytics
7. Cross-selling strategy insights based on network structure
8. Hybrid query execution that combines fast graph database traversals with deep GPU-accelerated analytics

## How we built it

We built GraphCatalyst as a hybrid GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation) system that integrates:

1. cuGraph for GPU-accelerated graph algorithms, providing orders of magnitude faster analysis for PageRank, community detection, and shortest path finding
2. NetworkX as a CPU fallback mechanism to ensure the system works in all environments
3. ArangoDB for efficient graph storage, indexing, and traversal queries
4. LangChain for creating an agentic app that intelligently selects the appropriate query strategy
5. Plotly and visualization libraries for creating interactive network visualizations
6. OpenAI's GPT models to power the natural language interface through LangChain
7. Python ecosystem for data processing, graph construction, and analysis

The architecture follows a dual-path approach:

- Simple relationship queries are handled by ArangoDB's optimized graph traversals
- Complex analytics are accelerated using cuGraph's GPU implementations when available
- The system dynamically selects the most appropriate execution path based on query complexity

## Challenges we ran into

During development, we encountered several significant challenges:

1. cuGraph API compatibility: The cuGraph API has evolved significantly, requiring us to implement robust error handling and alternative function paths to support different versions
2. Memory management for large graphs: GPU memory limitations required careful partitioning and sampling strategies for very large networks
3. Community detection at scale: Finding the optimal community detection algorithm for product networks required testing multiple approaches and implementing fallback strategies
4. Graph construction efficiency: Converting raw co-purchasing data into optimized graph structures efficiently required careful performance tuning
5. Hybrid query execution: Developing a system that could intelligently route queries between ArangoDB and cuGraph required careful design of the agent architecture
6. Designing an intuitive query interface: Creating natural language patterns that business users would naturally use to query product networks was challenging

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're particularly proud of several achievements in GraphCatalyst:

1. Seamless GPU/CPU integration: The system automatically leverages GPU acceleration when available while gracefully falling back to CPU processing when needed
2. Intelligent query routing: Our agentic architecture intelligently selects between ArangoDB and cuGraph based on query complexity
3. Business-friendly insights: Complex graph metrics are translated into actionable business recommendations
4. Visualization quality: Our interactive visualizations effectively communicate complex network structures and metrics
5. Performance improvements: Achieving order-of-magnitude speedups for large graph analytics through GPU acceleration
6. Robust error handling: The system degrades gracefully when encountering limitations or errors
